<!--Delivery index page-->

<!-- Route::get('/deliveryindextest', function(){
	return view ('delivery.delivery');
})

This should have some basic infos for delivery people: IE: names, email, current ratings/list of received comments, payment awaiting to receive from the store manager. etc. 
This should also have a list of orders that delivery people received from the store manager, and they can be clicked for details.
(go see checklist if this is not clear)
